      <p>Hi all! My name is Linnea and I am a full stack web developer. What started off as a hobby quickly
        built
        into
        a
        true passion of mine and I went
        from
        playing with HTML here and there, to building apps and websites.</p>
      <p>I have a diverse set of skills, ranging from responsive design, HTML + CSS + Javscript to mySQL, Node.js and React.
      </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio!</p>
